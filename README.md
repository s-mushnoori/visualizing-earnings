# visualizing-earnings
In this project, I have visualized data on different college majors. The dataset `recent-grads.csv` was obtained from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. A cleaned dataset was obtained from FiveThirtyEight's [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

Each row in the dataset represents a different college major, and contains information on gender distribution, unemployment rates, median salaries, etc.
