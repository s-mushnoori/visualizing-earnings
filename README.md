# visualizing-earnings
In this project, I have visualized data on different college majors. The data set `recent-grads.csv` can be found on the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. A cleaned data set was obtained from FiveThirtyEight's Github repo found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) was used for the analysis.

Each row in the data set represents a different college major, and contains information on gender distribution, unemployment rates, median salaries, etc. The pandas and numpy packages were used for the analysis, and matplotlib was used for the visualizations. The code can be viewed in `00_Visualization.ipynb`.

I have analyzed the data set to determine any interesting correlations between earnings and several variables for recent grads. *Some* of the questions addressed are:
 - What is the median salary for recent graduates?
 - How does the median salary differ for different major categories (eg. Engineering, Business, etc.)?
 - How does the median salary vary for majors in different categories (eg. Biomedical Engineering)?
 - What is the gender distribution for different major categories and majors?
 - Which major categories are the most popular (for each gender, and overall)?
 - How does the unemployment rate vary for different major categories?
